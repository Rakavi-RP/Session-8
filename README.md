# CIFAR-10 Classification with PyTorch

# Introduction

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It includes modularized scripts for data loading, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

# Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Classes include:Airplane,Automobile,Bird,Cat,Deer,Dog,Frog,Horse,Ship,Truck
